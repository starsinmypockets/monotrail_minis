# Monotroail Mini generator

Thanks to [Monotrail Tech Talks](https://www.youtube.com/@MonotrailTechTalk) for 
the great idea to generate  little prompts for musical ideas to practice, 
break the monotony, or get inspired!

I wrote a little script that will kick out these musical prompts.

## Installation

You need to [install nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

## Run

The run `node prompts` from the project root.

## Contribute

This is a dumb project I wrote in 20 minutes but if you want to add
to it just submit a PR and we'll whack it in there!

## Tests

There are no tests currently this is a dumb sketch of a project.
